    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is scheduled to report its Q4 earnings on January 30. Investors will be closely watching how SoFi’s revenue gets impacted in the current recessionary environment. But, in addition to tracking the headline financial figure, investors must also pay close attention to SoFi’s liquidity ratios, its member count, product sales, segment financials, and management’s outlook for Q1. These items will provide more color on the company’s operational positioning and are likely to influence where its shares will head next in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3 id="Rapid-Growth-Despite-Fears"><a href="#Rapid-Growth-Despite-Fears" class="headerlink" title="Rapid Growth Despite Fears"></a>Rapid Growth Despite Fears</h3><p>Despite some fears, SOFI has continued to grow quite rapidly. If we extrapolate this growth with a slowdown for the next 5-6 years, then SoFi can be valued as a traditional bank with an upside potential of about 30-50%. If we separate its Technology Platform segment, then the upside potential of the “fair value” can be more than 50%, with a small premium to the implied price-to-sales ratio of the industry average.</p>
<div class="alignright" style="margin-left:10px;">

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Banks-Fintech-Platform-Economies-Contextual/dp/1119756979?crid=2RVS065182RZE&keywords=fintech&qid=1674107126&sprefix=fintech%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-4&linkCode=li2&tag=highflyinginv-20&linkId=675cdaa991f5e6ef03e0997548d14c6e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" class="externalLink" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1119756979&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=highflyinginv-20&language=en_US"><br><span style="margin-top:10px;" class="caption">Future of Fintech</span></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=highflyinginv-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=1119756979" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></p>
</div>



<h3 id="Risks-to-Consider"><a href="#Risks-to-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Risks to Consider"></a>Risks to Consider</h3><p>There are a number of obvious risks to consider when looking at the potential of SoFi Technologies. First, a non-classical approach to cash flow calculation is used - it is impossible to value a bank using FCFF, so ROE and asset growth are primarily looked at. If the share of common equity as a percentage of total assets falls faster than expected and ROE stops growing at around 10%, the end result will not show the undervaluation currently being considered.</p>
<p>Second, the assessment of the Technology Platform segment is also quite subjective, as the sample companies used for comparison and the P/ ratio premium set are personal choices. There may be bias in this assessment.</p>
<p>The third point concerns the risk of a recession and, as a result, sustained inflation in the valuations of high-growth companies. Strong multiple contraction and concerns about the sustainability of the company’s business model led SoFi Technologies, along with other high-growth, unprofitable companies, to lose more than 77% of its market capitalization on the stock market since November 2021 (~80% from all-time highs). This poor price action may continue in the future if (SPY) bounces off its new resistance level and starts testing a new low shortly - by analogy with 2008.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Despite all the risks, however, SoFi Technologies seems to be an interesting growth company for a long-term investment. Even with a natural slowdown in current growth rates - which we see against the backdrop of an already turbulent global economy - SoFi’s intrinsic value is already higher than what one has to pay for it</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p><a href="/live-chart/?stock=ARKK">ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)</a> is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management. The fund tracks companies that are at the forefront of innovation, such as those involved in the development of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology.</p>
<h3 id="Recent-Performance-Challenges"><a href="#Recent-Performance-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Recent Performance Challenges"></a>Recent Performance Challenges</h3><p>ARKK has faced significant challenges in the past year, losing 68% in 2022 and is down 81% from its February 2021 peak. This underperformance has raised questions about the fund’s investment strategy and management.</p>
<h3 id="A-Long-term-Perspective"><a href="#A-Long-term-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="A Long-term Perspective"></a>A Long-term Perspective</h3><p>In a year-end letter to investors, Wood acknowledged the tough market environment but emphasized that the fund has a long-term investment horizon. She noted that “fear of the future is palpable these days, but crisis historically has created opportunities” and that “in hindsight, both of those times were terrific opportunities to put funds to work in highly differentiated ways.”</p>
<h3 id="A-Focus-on-Disruptive-Innovation"><a href="#A-Focus-on-Disruptive-Innovation" class="headerlink" title="A Focus on Disruptive Innovation"></a>A Focus on Disruptive Innovation</h3><p>ARKK’s portfolio is focused on companies that are driving disruptive innovation, which can lead to higher volatility and short-term underperformance. However, Wood believes that these companies are well-positioned for growth in the long-term, as they are solving problems and gaining traction during difficult times.</p>
<h3 id="Active-Management"><a href="#Active-Management" class="headerlink" title="Active Management"></a>Active Management</h3><p>ARKK is actively managed, which means that the fund’s portfolio is constantly being adjusted to reflect the changing dynamics of the market. This active management approach allows the fund to capitalize on new opportunities as they arise and to avoid sectors that are no longer attractive. The fund’s managers have a strong track record of identifying and investing in innovative companies that are well-positioned for growth.</p>
<h3 id="Analysis"><a href="#Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Analysis"></a>Analysis</h3><p>weather short-term market fluctuations, buying into disruptive innovation at near lows can lead to significant long-term returns. As investors, it is important to have a clear understanding of the risks involved in investing in a fund like ARKK, but also to have faith in the ability of the fund’s management team to navigate a tough market environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to note that innovation is the future and it is important to have a portion of one’s portfolio invested in companies at the forefront of new technologies and ideas. The world is constantly changing and evolving, and companies leading the charge in innovation are likely to be the ones shaping our future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while ARKK has faced challenges in the past year, it is important to consider the long-term potential and the fund’s focus on disruptive innovation. As always, it is important to conduct thorough research and to consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.</p>

<p><a href="/live-chart/?stock=DMTK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DermTech, Inc.(<strong>DMTK</strong>)</a>  is a medical technology company that is revolutionizing the way melanoma is diagnosed. The company’s genomic tests provide a differentiated approach to examining and diagnosing melanoma, an otherwise complex task. The company’s pigmented lesion division is its clear differentiator within the domain, and its DermTech Melanoma Test is a breakthrough in the market.</p>
<p>Despite the company’s innovative approach and differentiated growth prospects, DMTK’s stock performance in both 2021 and 2022 has been disappointing. DermTech’s management has blamed this on limited commercial payer coverage for the company’s skin genomics tests. The company hasn’t reported its full-year 2022 revenue yet, but CEO John Dobak warned in November that it’s likely to come in below the previous guidance range. Dobak attributed this to “growth in utilization with certain customers is tempered because of typical payor tactics to impede our adoption momentum.”</p>
<br>
<img style="width:50%;" src="/images/dmtk-bandaid.png">


<p>However, DermTech started off the new year with some positive news. On January 5, 2023, DermTech announced positive coverage decisions from four Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which added roughly 13 million covered lives for DermTech’s melanoma test. Five days later, DermTech announced that its melanoma test had been recommended for coverage by Tricare, a federal healthcare program for armed services members, retirees, and their families that covers around 9 million people. This brought DermTech’s total covered lives to 113 million, a 24% increase from the end of 2022 and nearly doubled the number of non-Medicare covered lives.</p>
<p>Dobak stated in DermTech’s Q3 update that the company could add between 30 million and 40 million covered lives by the end of 2023 Q1. These recent developments suggest that he may be right.</p>
<p>DermTech is targeting a melanoma testing market of around $2.5 billion per year and is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this market. The company’s melanoma tests are 17 times less likely to miss a melanoma diagnosis, don’t require incisions, and are more cost-effective than surgical biopsies. However, the melanoma market is just the tip of the iceberg. DermTech believes that there’s a $10 billion annual opportunity in screening and assessing risk for more types of skin cancer. The company is testing a product called Luminate that evaluates damage from ultraviolet rays and assesses skin care risk, which could significantly expand DermTech’s addressable market.</p>

<p>While DermTech has a long way to go to achieve impressive commercial success, gaining government and private-payer coverage is a good start. The company must now convince more doctors to use its skin genomics tests and help patients and providers navigate the hurdles that insurers sometimes put in place. However, investors should recognize that DermTech could be years away from profitability. It’s important that the company be more niggardly with their spending as they are not yet profitable. But for those willing to take a chance on the company, the potential rewards could be significant. DermTech’s unique approach to melanoma diagnosis may be just what the market needs, and the company’s potential for growth in the future is undeniable.</p>

<p>The Mustang Mach-E, the Detroit automaker’s biggest bet on EVs, beat out Tesla’s Model 3 as Consumer Report’s “Top Pick”  for the 2022 electric vehicle of the year. The F-150 Lightning, an electric version of the industry’s best-selling pickup, already has some 200,000 deposits. </p>
<p>EV sales have been forecast to comprise 34.2% of new US auto sales by 2030. If Ford can raise funds with an EV IPO and ramp production of its electric pickup line, shareholders could be in a good position to realize some value in the case of a spinoff of the EV division.</p>

<h3 id="Strategic-Fit"><a href="#Strategic-Fit" class="headerlink" title="Strategic Fit"></a>Strategic Fit</h3><p>Late in 2020, Apple launched Apple Fitness+ which offers home workouts via their products. In the latest earnings call’s Apple CEO Tim Cook announced some new features for the company’s Fitness platform.</p>

<p>While Apple has made several smaller acquisitions over the years, the largest hardware acquisition in the company’s history was in 2014 when the company purchases Beats. At the time Apple was focusing on their music subscription business and the Beats purchase helped bring renewed attention to Apple’s music offering.   </p>
<p>Now that Apple is investing in the growth of their fitness business, an acquisition such a Peloton may make a lot of strategic help, similar to how Beats helped their music subscription service gain traction.</p>
<p>Apple consistently holds one of the largest piles of cash on hand out of any corporations. At the end of January, they were sitting on reserves of $195.57 billion. To put that in perspective, Amazon, one of the leading contenders for a Peloton takeover, had “only” $68.4 billion in reserves at their last quarter end. </p>
<p>Additionally, Apple could bring their strong music platform to Peloton, broadening the artists and songs offered in classes. As a Peloton user, one area I believe they’ve always needed to improve on was their music library.</p>

With the rising interest rates, and a more hawkish Fed some investors are looking to reposition to perceived safer sectors in the current environment.  In recent history, FAAMG/FANG mega-cap tech has proved itself as a safer, and lucrative place to have your money in recent history — but will it continue in the current climate?  Let’s take a look.</p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/bigtech2021.png" alt="Big Tech">

<p>While the mega-tech stocks had extremely impressive revenue and earnings growth, their multiples have also expanded to near historic highs.  And though this can be justified by higher growth rates, and within the context of higher overall market multiples, those who are worried about compressing multiple environments due to inflation, and rising Treasury yield, may want to look at another area of the market which is potentially offering a rare opportunity.</p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/bigtech2021_2.png" alt="Beaten Down Growth">

<p>While revenue has undoubtedly grown, the valuations have grown unproportionally and these stocks are trading at multiples not seen in 20 years.  If stock multiples contract, these have a long way down to go. </p>

<p>Unlike the S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq 100, small to mid-cap growth has been in a bear market since February 2021 — not something one would gather by looking purely at the major averages, largely because of the tilted weightings of the mega cap giants we mentioned previously.   Many smaller, mid cap growth stocks peaked in February or November 2021, and are 50% or more from their highs.  Of course federal stimulus, a retail frenzy in the market, and stocks priced for a never-ending pandemic likely caused many of the stocks in this cohort to climb to unjust elevations which some may never see again.   However, the recent selling pressure in this area of the market has been nearly indiscriminate while the underlying businesses, are all very different, with distinct prospects and valuations.  We believe this presents long term investors a great opportunity to individually examine specific stocks that are trading at historically low multiples to find great opportunities.  Certainly some of the names will not be great companies with sound fundamentals, but companies like Sea Limited (<strong>SE</strong>), Teladoc (<strong>TDOC</strong>),  Block (<strong>SQ</strong>), Elastic (<strong>ESTC</strong>)  remain as strong as ever, with growing revenues, sound fundamentals and historically low multiples and this may be a great time to add to or start positions in some of theses names. </p>

<p>Taking a look at a few high-growth stocks which have had massive stock price appreciation over the past two years, but have also had massive falls in recent months, we see that their EV/revenue multiples have sharply contracted and are now trading at or below pre-pandemic levels.  While we shouldn’t think that earlier, at their highest prices and multiple is their “true value”, it’s unlikely that many of these companies, who have secular growth drivers, and accelerating revenue growth rates,  will stay at their lowest 5 year multiples either. </p>

<p>While each of the above stocks have different businesses and fundamentals which we urge investors to look at individually, there is likely an opportunity, as many great, growing companies have been discarded with the sector as a whole.  One of the most egregious examples of pandemic stocks that grew to wild valuation and has since drastically corrected in <a href="/live-chart/?stock=ZM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom (<strong>ZM</strong>)</a>. It along with Peloton (<strong>PTON</strong>) have been the notorious poster child for the “stay at home stocks”.   In addition to the recent sector sell-off, Peloton has been hurt by disappointing earnings results, making some on Wall Street question the soundness of the business.  Zoom, on the other hand, is a profitable business with a great balance sheet and while it’s lack of optionality may rightfully concern some investors, whose stock has been recently beaten down with the same exuberance it was propelled to wild valuation at the start of 2021.  And while valuing growth companies we usually look at revenue multiples, but with Zoom being profitable we can look at PE ratio — and with all of the recent negative sentiment around valuation, it may surprise many that at these recent heavily depressed levels Zoom has a forward PE lower than some traditional S&amp;P companies. </p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h2 id="Splunk-SPLK-Earnings"><a href="#Splunk-SPLK-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Splunk (SPLK) Earnings"></a>Splunk (SPLK) Earnings</h2><p>Disappointing Q3 earnings hit the Splunk (<strong>SPLK</strong>) stock hard after the revenue missed expectations and YoY revenue growth. The revenue miss was attributed to a few “larger deals, high-seven-figure, eight-figure deals” not being closed in the expected quarter.</p>
<p>While a fall in revenue growth can quickly damper a high growth, high multiple stock, as it did last earnings with Splunk, we expect the disappointing result of last quarter to a be a onetime blip. At current levels, this seems like a good buying opportunity and with a favorable the risk/reward.</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-Splunk-Do"><a href="#What-Does-Splunk-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Does Splunk Do?"></a>What Does Splunk Do?</h3><p>Splunk (SPLK) positions itself as cloud “data-to-everything” platform. Splunk is a business to business software, used by IT, DevOps, Developers, Data Scientists, Security Ops amongst others to collect, store, visualize and report on data from various different systems. Splunk is well known and well respected in the industry and is a leader in their space.</p>
<p>Domino’s (<strong>DPZ</strong>) is a long time Splunk customer and is a company that has focused on becoming more of a tech company than just a restaurant chain over the last decade. Domino’s has a popular in-house pizza ordering and delivering system, and while we don’t know exactly what they use Splunk for, it’s not unreasonable to assume they are sending all of their order, delivery, franchise, server data to Splunk. Having all of these different data sources in aggregate may help the company identify abnormalities in their operations and be able to track and report on analytics such as changes in delivery times, outages, supply chain issues, and identify seasonal, geographical patterns in usage.</p>
<p>Splunk can also similarly track data reported to cyber security, and help customers identify security abnormalities and detect threats via their Enterprise Security software.</p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/splunk_screenshot.png" alt="Splunk Screenshot">

<h3 id="SPLK-Valuation"><a href="#SPLK-Valuation" class="headerlink" title="SPLK Valuation"></a>SPLK Valuation</h3><p>Comparing Splunk’s price to sales ratio to two other cloud, b2b cloud software companies, you can see SPLK has long been trading at a discount to MongoDB(<strong>MDB</strong>) and Elastics(<strong>ESTC</strong>), and has fallen further over the last several month. It’s now trading at just over 10x sales, which is on the lower end in the cloud software space — and likely due to the lower revenue growth rate, especially given last quarter’s results.</p>
<p>While all three are not yet profitable, Splunk also has had the largest EBITDA margin, a company’s profit as a percentage of its revenue, until just the previous earnings from ESTC, which is now at -19.77% vs SPLK’s -25.89 vs MDB’s -32.12%. Splunk was also just recently over taken in market cap size by MDB which stands at 23.26 billion vs SPLK’s 23.12 billion vs ESTC 12.05.</p>
<img src="/images/SPLK_PS_Compare.jpeg" alt="SPLK P/S vs Peers">

<h3 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>Business to business SaaS software sales which rely on several large deals a quarter to lock in new revenue, often have a difficult time predicting exactly which quarter a new prospect will sign on. When a larger company signs on to use a new software across the enterprise there is usually a need for a large effort to implement and roll out the new software and is usually a substantial cost for the organizations which need to be approved, planned and reviewed by legal before signing a contract. The larger the customer the more red-tape and process may exist, delaying the process.</p>
<p>Given this, we would expect that several of those expected Q3 deals moved into Q4, and we think it’s very likely they will beat the conservative expectations analysts set for this quarter. The stock is currently trading at an almost 35% discount from its <a href="/live-chart/?stock=SPLK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">52 week high in September 2020 of $223.59</a> and if the Splunk management team can deliver and help push the revenue growth rated to previous levels we see plenty of upside ahead of Splunk. We also like that Splunk has very high institutional ownership, currently over 93%, however insider have less than 1% ownership which some mays see as a slight concern.</p>
<p>Overall, given Splunk’s solid product, wide adoption, and previous solid revenue growth we think the previous earnings report was likely an aberration and we see plenty of upside ahead.</p>
