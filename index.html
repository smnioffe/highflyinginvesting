<p><a href="/live-chart/?stock=DMTK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DermTech, Inc.(<strong>DMTK</strong>)</a>  is a medical technology company that is revolutionizing the way melanoma is diagnosed. The company’s genomic tests provide a differentiated approach to examining and diagnosing melanoma, an otherwise complex task. The company’s pigmented lesion division is its clear differentiator within the domain, and its DermTech Melanoma Test is a breakthrough in the market.</p>
<p>Despite the company’s innovative approach and differentiated growth prospects, DMTK’s stock performance in both 2021 and 2022 has been disappointing. DermTech’s management has blamed this on limited commercial payer coverage for the company’s skin genomics tests. The company hasn’t reported its full-year 2022 revenue yet, but CEO John Dobak warned in November that it’s likely to come in below the previous guidance range. Dobak attributed this to “growth in utilization with certain customers is tempered because of typical payor tactics to impede our adoption momentum.”</p>
<br>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/dmtk-bandaid.png" alt="DMTK Bandaid>


<p>However, DermTech started off the new year with some positive news. On January 5, 2023, DermTech announced positive coverage decisions from four Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which added roughly 13 million covered lives for DermTech’s melanoma test. Five days later, DermTech announced that its melanoma test had been recommended for coverage by Tricare, a federal healthcare program for armed services members, retirees, and their families that covers around 9 million people. This brought DermTech’s total covered lives to 113 million, a 24% increase from the end of 2022 and nearly doubled the number of non-Medicare covered lives.</p>
<p>Dobak stated in DermTech’s Q3 update that the company could add between 30 million and 40 million covered lives by the end of 2023 Q1. These recent developments suggest that he may be right.</p>
<p>DermTech is targeting a melanoma testing market of around $2.5 billion per year and is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this market. The company’s melanoma tests are 17 times less likely to miss a melanoma diagnosis, don’t require incisions, and are more cost-effective than surgical biopsies. However, the melanoma market is just the tip of the iceberg. DermTech believes that there’s a $10 billion annual opportunity in screening and assessing risk for more types of skin cancer. The company is testing a product called Luminate that evaluates damage from ultraviolet rays and assesses skin care risk, which could significantly expand DermTech’s addressable market.</p>

     <script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&Operation=GetScript&ID=OneJS&WS=1"></script>
    


<p>While DermTech has a long way to go to achieve impressive commercial success, gaining government and private-payer coverage is a good start. The company must now convince more doctors to use its skin genomics tests and help patients and providers navigate the hurdles that insurers sometimes put in place. However, investors should recognize that DermTech could be years away from profitability. It’s important that the company be more niggardly with their spending as they are not yet profitable. But for those willing to take a chance on the company, the potential rewards could be significant. DermTech’s unique approach to melanoma diagnosis may be just what the market needs, and the company’s potential for growth in the future is undeniable.</p>

<p>The Mustang Mach-E, the Detroit automaker’s biggest bet on EVs, beat out Tesla’s Model 3 as Consumer Report’s “Top Pick”  for the 2022 electric vehicle of the year. The F-150 Lightning, an electric version of the industry’s best-selling pickup, already has some 200,000 deposits. </p>
<p>EV sales have been forecast to comprise 34.2% of new US auto sales by 2030. If Ford can raise funds with an EV IPO and ramp production of its electric pickup line, shareholders could be in a good position to realize some value in the case of a spinoff of the EV division.</p>

<p>While Apple has made several smaller acquisitions over the years, the largest hardware acquisition in the company’s history was in 2014 when the company purchases Beats. At the time Apple was focusing on their music subscription business and the Beats purchase helped bring renewed attention to Apple’s music offering.   </p>
<p>Now that Apple is investing in the growth of their fitness business, an acquisition such a Peloton may make a lot of strategic help, similar to how Beats helped their music subscription service gain traction.</p>
<p>Apple consistently holds one of the largest piles of cash on hand out of any corporations. At the end of January, they were sitting on reserves of $195.57 billion. To put that in perspective, Amazon, one of the leading contenders for a Peloton takeover, had “only” $68.4 billion in reserves at their last quarter end. </p>
<p>Additionally, Apple could bring their strong music platform to Peloton, broadening the artists and songs offered in classes. As a Peloton user, one area I believe they’ve always needed to improve on was their music library.</p>

With the rising interest rates, and a more hawkish Fed some investors are looking to reposition to perceived safer sectors in the current environment.  In recent history, FAAMG/FANG mega-cap tech has proved itself as a safer, and lucrative place to have your money in recent history — but will it continue in the current climate?  Let’s take a look.</p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/bigtech2021.png" alt="Big Tech">

<p>While the mega-tech stocks had extremely impressive revenue and earnings growth, their multiples have also expanded to near historic highs.  And though this can be justified by higher growth rates, and within the context of higher overall market multiples, those who are worried about compressing multiple environments due to inflation, and rising Treasury yield, may want to look at another area of the market which is potentially offering a rare opportunity.</p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/bigtech2021_2.png" alt="Beaten Down Growth">

<p>While revenue has undoubtedly grown, the valuations have grown unproportionally and these stocks are trading at multiples not seen in 20 years.  If stock multiples contract, these have a long way down to go. </p>
<h3 id="Hidden-Value"><a href="#Hidden-Value" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Value"></a>Hidden Value</h3><div class="alignright" style="margin-left:10px;">
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Stack-Building-Unbeatable-Business/dp/B085DRSV7K?crid=5M7IVF40PEGB&keywords=jack+dorsey&qid=1642469270&s=audible&sprefix=jack+dorsey%2Caudible%2C86&sr=1-2&linkCode=li3&tag=highflyinginv-20&linkId=13bf4e5d5f7c5c3733041e607bcc1587&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img class="externalLink" border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B085DRSV7K&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=highflyinginv-20&language=en_US"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=highflyinginv-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B085DRSV7K" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">

<p>Unlike the S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq 100, small to mid-cap growth has been in a bear market since February 2021 — not something one would gather by looking purely at the major averages, largely because of the tilted weightings of the mega cap giants we mentioned previously.   Many smaller, mid cap growth stocks peaked in February or November 2021, and are 50% or more from their highs.  Of course federal stimulus, a retail frenzy in the market, and stocks priced for a never-ending pandemic likely caused many of the stocks in this cohort to climb to unjust elevations which some may never see again.   However, the recent selling pressure in this area of the market has been nearly indiscriminate while the underlying businesses, are all very different, with distinct prospects and valuations.  We believe this presents long term investors a great opportunity to individually examine specific stocks that are trading at historically low multiples to find great opportunities.  Certainly some of the names will not be great companies with sound fundamentals, but companies like Sea Limited (<strong>SE</strong>), Teladoc (<strong>TDOC</strong>),  Block (<strong>SQ</strong>), Elastic (<strong>ESTC</strong>)  remain as strong as ever, with growing revenues, sound fundamentals and historically low multiples and this may be a great time to add to or start positions in some of theses names. </p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/growth2021.png" alt="Beaten Down Growth">

<p>Taking a look at a few high-growth stocks which have had massive stock price appreciation over the past two years, but have also had massive falls in recent months, we see that their EV/revenue multiples have sharply contracted and are now trading at or below pre-pandemic levels.  While we shouldn’t think that earlier, at their highest prices and multiple is their “true value”, it’s unlikely that many of these companies, who have secular growth drivers, and accelerating revenue growth rates,  will stay at their lowest 5 year multiples either. </p>
<div class="alignright" style="margin-left:10px;">
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Ashlee-Vance-audiobook/dp/B00UVY52JO?keywords=story+of+elon+musk&qid=1642469173&sprefix=story+of+elo%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-2&linkCode=li3&tag=highflyinginv-20&linkId=acb8048d7680f5895995fa688ec38360&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" class="externalLink" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVY52JO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=highflyinginv-20&language=en_US"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=highflyinginv-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B00UVY52JO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">

<p>While each of the above stocks have different businesses and fundamentals which we urge investors to look at individually, there is likely an opportunity, as many great, growing companies have been discarded with the sector as a whole.  One of the most egregious examples of pandemic stocks that grew to wild valuation and has since drastically corrected in <a href="/live-chart/?stock=ZM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom (<strong>ZM</strong>)</a>. It along with Peloton (<strong>PTON</strong>) have been the notorious poster child for the “stay at home stocks”.   In addition to the recent sector sell-off, Peloton has been hurt by disappointing earnings results, making some on Wall Street question the soundness of the business.  Zoom, on the other hand, is a profitable business with a great balance sheet and while it’s lack of optionality may rightfully concern some investors, whose stock has been recently beaten down with the same exuberance it was propelled to wild valuation at the start of 2021.  And while valuing growth companies we usually look at revenue multiples, but with Zoom being profitable we can look at PE ratio — and with all of the recent negative sentiment around valuation, it may surprise many that at these recent heavily depressed levels Zoom has a forward PE lower than some traditional S&amp;P companies. </p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h2 id="Splunk-SPLK-Earnings"><a href="#Splunk-SPLK-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Splunk (SPLK) Earnings"></a>Splunk (SPLK) Earnings</h2><p>Disappointing Q3 earnings hit the Splunk (<strong>SPLK</strong>) stock hard after the revenue missed expectations and YoY revenue growth. The revenue miss was attributed to a few “larger deals, high-seven-figure, eight-figure deals” not being closed in the expected quarter.</p>
<p>While a fall in revenue growth can quickly damper a high growth, high multiple stock, as it did last earnings with Splunk, we expect the disappointing result of last quarter to a be a onetime blip. At current levels, this seems like a good buying opportunity and with a favorable the risk/reward.</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-Splunk-Do"><a href="#What-Does-Splunk-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Does Splunk Do?"></a>What Does Splunk Do?</h3><p>Splunk (SPLK) positions itself as cloud “data-to-everything” platform. Splunk is a business to business software, used by IT, DevOps, Developers, Data Scientists, Security Ops amongst others to collect, store, visualize and report on data from various different systems. Splunk is well known and well respected in the industry and is a leader in their space.</p>
<p>Domino’s (<strong>DPZ</strong>) is a long time Splunk customer and is a company that has focused on becoming more of a tech company than just a restaurant chain over the last decade. Domino’s has a popular in-house pizza ordering and delivering system, and while we don’t know exactly what they use Splunk for, it’s not unreasonable to assume they are sending all of their order, delivery, franchise, server data to Splunk. Having all of these different data sources in aggregate may help the company identify abnormalities in their operations and be able to track and report on analytics such as changes in delivery times, outages, supply chain issues, and identify seasonal, geographical patterns in usage.</p>
<p>Splunk can also similarly track data reported to cyber security, and help customers identify security abnormalities and detect threats via their Enterprise Security software.</p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/splunk_screenshot.png" alt="Splunk Screenshot">

<h3 id="SPLK-Valuation"><a href="#SPLK-Valuation" class="headerlink" title="SPLK Valuation"></a>SPLK Valuation</h3><p>Comparing Splunk’s price to sales ratio to two other cloud, b2b cloud software companies, you can see SPLK has long been trading at a discount to MongoDB(<strong>MDB</strong>) and Elastics(<strong>ESTC</strong>), and has fallen further over the last several month. It’s now trading at just over 10x sales, which is on the lower end in the cloud software space — and likely due to the lower revenue growth rate, especially given last quarter’s results.</p>
<p>While all three are not yet profitable, Splunk also has had the largest EBITDA margin, a company’s profit as a percentage of its revenue, until just the previous earnings from ESTC, which is now at -19.77% vs SPLK’s -25.89 vs MDB’s -32.12%. Splunk was also just recently over taken in market cap size by MDB which stands at 23.26 billion vs SPLK’s 23.12 billion vs ESTC 12.05.</p>
<img src="/images/SPLK_PS_Compare.jpeg" alt="SPLK P/S vs Peers">

<h3 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>Business to business SaaS software sales which rely on several large deals a quarter to lock in new revenue, often have a difficult time predicting exactly which quarter a new prospect will sign on. When a larger company signs on to use a new software across the enterprise there is usually a need for a large effort to implement and roll out the new software and is usually a substantial cost for the organizations which need to be approved, planned and reviewed by legal before signing a contract. The larger the customer the more red-tape and process may exist, delaying the process.</p>
<p>Given this, we would expect that several of those expected Q3 deals moved into Q4, and we think it’s very likely they will beat the conservative expectations analysts set for this quarter. The stock is currently trading at an almost 35% discount from its <a href="/live-chart/?stock=SPLK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">52 week high in September 2020 of $223.59</a> and if the Splunk management team can deliver and help push the revenue growth rated to previous levels we see plenty of upside ahead of Splunk. We also like that Splunk has very high institutional ownership, currently over 93%, however insider have less than 1% ownership which some mays see as a slight concern.</p>
<p>Overall, given Splunk’s solid product, wide adoption, and previous solid revenue growth we think the previous earnings report was likely an aberration and we see plenty of upside ahead.</p>

<p>Sea Limited has begun more aggressively expanding into Brazil, and if successful is reportedly considering expanding further into South America. Looking at Shopee’s Brazilian site traffic, we see it’s increased 3x within just three months. According to Alexa ranking, it’s now ranked the 51st most popular site in Brazil.</p>

<h2 id="What-to-Expect"><a href="#What-to-Expect" class="headerlink" title="What to Expect"></a>What to Expect</h2><p>SE has rarely beaten EPS estimates and usually falls short. However, in the last year it’s consistently beaten revenue estimates.</p>
<p>We expect this trend to continue, and aren’t worried about EPS misses since the company is heavily investing in its growth and has done so successfully. As long as the revenue growth is continuing and guidance remains strong, regardless of EPS numbers, are outlook remains bullish on SE. If the stock doesn’t react well based on an EPS miss, as long as strong revenue and guidance remain intact we would consider it a good buying opportunity.</p>

        <h2 id="Lucid-Motors-What-We-Know"><a href="#Lucid-Motors-What-We-Know" class="headerlink" title="Lucid Motors - What We Know"></a>Lucid Motors - What We Know</h2><p>There EV(electric vehicle) maker Lucid Motors Inc. is in talks to go public through a merger with one Churchill Capital IV (CCIV), one of Michael Klein’s special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), according to several reports today. </p>
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/lucid-air.jpeg" alt="Lucid Air Source: Lucid Motors">

<p>While the Lucid Air vehicle is not yet available to purchase, it is planned to be available in the US later in 2021 and should cost below $80k. The company has spent a good amount of money on TV advertisements recently, and have been raising consumer awareness. It’s likely the largest potential Tesla(TSLA) competitor that has not gone public. Lucid is funded by the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund.</p>
<p>The deal could be valued at up to $15 billion. According to reports the talks are still ongoing, and there is no guarantee yet the trade will go through.</p>
<h3 id="Our-Thoughts"><a href="#Our-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Our Thoughts"></a>Our Thoughts</h3><p>We don’t know yet if this deal will actually close or is premature - there have been plenty of SPACs that move up sharply on some leaked news or rumors but quickly fall back down when it doesn’t come to fruition. And while we don’t have much information to value this deal, or Lucid as a business, we do know there has been an EV mania in the market. Even EV companies that don’t have a planned product for years, or make industrial components that retail investors don’t fully understand have received highly premium valuations. Lucid Air however, actually has physical cars which should be released within a year, with a very appealing design and cars made for consumers. So if CCIV does indeed merge with Lucid, we would expect a lot of retail mania here drive up the price and think this may be an interesting opportunity for a short term trade. However, since the deal may fall apart and there has been no formal announcements we would start with only a modest common shares position, or buy the warrants - which is similar to buying a call option with a strike of $11.50.</p>

<p>After Jack Ma of Alibaba (<strong>BABA</strong>) offered some critique of Chinese regulators, the government quickly suspended Ma’s other venture’s, Ant Group’s, highly anticipated IPO. The stock began moving lower on this news from it’s all-time highs in October of 319. Then  on December 24th,  it was announced that the Chinese government would open up an antitrust investigation into Alibaba which further put pressure on the stock with it dropping <a href="/live-chart/?stock=BABA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 13% in one day</a>.   It seems to us, this is clearly intent to publicly humiliate Jack Ma by Chinese President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party.   The government wants to remind him that even though he’s a wildly successful tech entrepreneur, he is not beyond the system and establishment, and want him to bow down to them and their oppressive regime. </p>
<p>While Alibaba may need to pay some fines and face some public humiliation, we can’t envision these event jeopardizing the very successful business or ultimately penalizing its shareholders once the dust settles. In the most recent quarter Alibaba posted 30% YoY revenue growth, 60% YoY cloud computing revenue growth. We were especially pleased on the cloud computing number since this is a rapidly expanding industry and can become a successful revenue driving cash cow SaS line of business for Alibaba, supplementing the company’s e-commerce revenue.</p>
<p>With China’s goal of expanding their tech presence, continuing driving their economy to global expansion, it becomes almost unthinkable that this was more than a way to put Alibaba and Ma on alert and to remind them to behave as the communist party expects.  There has also been some additional pressure on Chinese equities with the Trump administration, but we think with the new Biden administration there will be less foreign policy surprises and expect to see Chinese equities to fair well, or at least not be further hindered, under the next US administration.  All in all, we think this is a buying opportunity.</p>

<p>Selling a put is giving the buyer of the put the right to sell you 100 shares at the strike price. In this case $220.  But since this is a spread, we’re hedging ourselves quite a bit.  If we were to just sell the $220 put we would receive over $1000 dollars in credit, but if stock went to $100, we would have to buy 100 shares at $220 and we would be down $12,000 (minus the premium we received and keep either way).  </p>
<p>However, since it’s a spread, we’re buying a cheaper $215 put, in addition to selling one.  The put we buy is $240 dollars less than the put we sell, which is the credit we receive.  Entering the spread, limits our credit received, but also greatly reduces our max loss to the width of the strikes ($220-$215) minus the credit we receive $240, which is how we calculate our max loss.</p>
<p>At this time BABA is just a nickel below 222. So as long as BABA stays at this level or goes higher by the expiration date, 1/29, the puts will expire worthless and either way we keep the $240 credit. In fact, if the stock goes down to $220, we still get the full max gain.  The breakeven point is the short put spread $220 minus the credit received $2.40, which is  $217.4. So we’re in the green as long as BABA stays above $217.4.  Anything below $215, and we incur the max loss, $260.</p>
<h3 id="Managing-the-Trade"><a href="#Managing-the-Trade" class="headerlink" title="Managing the Trade"></a>Managing the Trade</h3><p>We started with a modest width between the strikes, which yield a smaller gain but gives us the chance to roll the spread later if the stock does go below $220.  For example, if BABA went to $200, and we were still bullish on the stock, in one transaction we could buy to close our $220 put, and sell to close our $215 put and open up a longer dated spread, with a wider width and collect even more premium - even as the stock moves against us.  So in this example, we may be able to then roll the spread into a $205/$195 February or March spread. While this would increase our max risk, we would have a higher probability of success. However, this should only be done if your conviction hasn’t change on the stock.</p>
