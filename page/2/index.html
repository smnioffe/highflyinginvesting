        <p>Cathie Wood is the CEO/CIO of ARK Invest, which include the wildly successful and growlingly popular <strong>ARKK</strong> Innovation ETF and <strong>ARKG</strong> Genomic Revolutions ETF.  In an interview with Bloomberg, Woods recently said: “The biggest upside surprises are going to come from the genomic space, and that’s because the convergence of DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence, and gene therapies are going to cure disease”.  This interview helped propel many biotech stocks in the gene therapy space.  Today we’re looking at two of our favorite CRISPR stocks:</p>
<br>

<h2 id="Editas-Medicine-EDIT"><a href="#Editas-Medicine-EDIT" class="headerlink" title="Editas Medicine (EDIT)"></a>Editas Medicine (EDIT)</h2><h4 id="Market-Cap-5-21-billion"><a href="#Market-Cap-5-21-billion" class="headerlink" title="Market Cap: 5.21 billion"></a>Market Cap: 5.21 billion</h4><p>Editas Medicine (EDIT) is a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing company, along with <strong>CRSP</strong>, <strong>NTLA</strong>, <strong>BEAM</strong>.   These CRISPR companies are perusing treatments of genetic diseases, by a process which uses a Cas9 protein to find a specific DNA sequence, and then cuts it at that location and inserts new DNA in place.  This is of course a very crude summary, but can help provide context on the technology.</p>
<p>Editas has a large pipeline of several potential treatments and applications of its technology.  Currently, one is in Phase 1/2 clinical trial and is attempting to target the mutant genes associated with genetic blindness.  As of now, there are no cures or effective treatments for this type of blindness.  This is also the first time an in-vivo CRISPR treatment has been done as part of a clinical study. The in-vivo CRISPR approach is administered directly delivered into the patient and the gene editing occurs within the person’s body. While ex-vivo, the other method of delivery for these type of treatments, relies on first taking the patients cells, and editing them outside the body, before transplanting them back into the body.   If all goes well in trial, Editas will be the clear leader of in-vivo CRISPR treatments.</p>
<p>The company’s pipeline also includes EDIT-301, which targets to treat Sickle Cell Disease.  EDIT-201 for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.  Editas also has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.editasmedicine.com/gene-editing-pipeline/">other treatments</a>  for both ex-vivo and in-vivo treatments and has partnered with other companies to develop and research these potential treatments. </p>
<p>Editas has secured enough cash to be run through 2023 - but make no mistake, this is a pre-revenue company.<br><br></p>

<h2 id="Beam-Therapeutics-BEAM"><a href="#Beam-Therapeutics-BEAM" class="headerlink" title="Beam Therapeutics (BEAM)"></a>Beam Therapeutics (BEAM)</h2><h4 id="Market-Cap-5-06-billion"><a href="#Market-Cap-5-06-billion" class="headerlink" title="Market Cap: 5.06 billion"></a>Market Cap: 5.06 billion</h4><p>Beam Therapeutics (BEAM)  is up 275% since its February 2020 IPO and has more than doubled over the last month. </p>
<p>Beam is a very promising biotech company developing precision genetic editing medicines, utilizing the very hot CRSPR technology.  The company was founded by David Liu, a pioneer in the field, who previously founded Editas(<strong>EDIT</strong>) - another leader of the CRISPR biotech space.   Beam stands out in this field by its use of base editing which can target single edits in DNA with great precision with chemical reactions.  Other companies in the field like <strong>CRSP</strong>, <strong>EDIT</strong>, <strong>NTLA</strong> use genetic editing which make double-stranded cuts in the DNA, and while that technology is farther ahead, has technical issues that still need to be overcome – primarily unintended cuts in the DNA which may have unintended consequences like cancer.  But due to the greater efficiency in base editing technology, it generally has more precision and less issues with unwanted DNA changes to overcome.  Though these issues are not completely unheard of with base editing either and more work is needed especially since this is a newer technology.  </p>
<p>While there are many diseases that BEAM could use this technology to potentially address, the most immediate one is sickle cell anemia which is caused by a point mutation, exactly what base editing could one day treat more efficiently than the more involved gene editing approach. In fact, BEAM is currently pursuing two different base editing approaches to treat red blood cell disorders.</p>

<h2 id="Digital-Payment-is-the-Future"><a href="#Digital-Payment-is-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Digital Payment is the Future"></a>Digital Payment is the Future</h2><p>Both Mastercard (<strong>MA</strong>) and Visa (<strong>V</strong>) are solid portfolio bedrock stocks to have in a diversified portfolio.  For growth investors, they may somewhat reduce the volatility of a more aggrieve portfolio, yet still have produce returns which have been beating the S&amp;P for several years. </p>
<p>The number one driver is the growth in digital payments, made both in physical retail locations and especially the growing e-commerce space.  And the global opportunity is even larger when considering the global economy, especially emerging markets.  Globally, electronic payments have just a couple of years ago eclipsed cash payments. </p>
<p>In 2020, reduced travel, especially business travel, has been somewhat of a headwind for the industry, but increased e-commerce transactions has helped the revenue bounce back from the lows, and finished the year with a year over year increase 1-5% in transactions.  </p>
<p>Both Visa and MasterCard make most of its revenue from service and data processing fees.  Unlike American Express and Discover, Visa and Mastercard have almost no consumer debt exposure.</p>
<h2 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h2><p>Visa is the larger and more dominant player in the space, and Mastercard is the number two player - think Coke and Pepsi.  Both are growing domestically and internationally, and in some countries one has a larger footprint than the other.   Visa has a slightly larger dividend, but Mastercard has been growing faster the past several years.   While both are solid stocks, we like Mastercard a bit better because of the growth and continued larger growth opportunities.  </p>

<h3 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h3><p>DermTech is attempting to reduce the need for costly, invasive and inconvenient methods currently required to detect skin cancer.  The company uses a patch, resembling a circular band-aid, which patients can place on themselves and then mail to DermTech’s laboratory where the subsequent testing is done on the collected sample.   The laboratory uses molecular testing on skin cell samples, to check for two genes associated with melanoma.</p>

<h3 id="Why-it-Moved"><a href="#Why-it-Moved" class="headerlink" title="Why it Moved"></a>Why it Moved</h3><p>On December 17th, 2020 the topline results of Dermtech’s study was announced. These results confirmed the high negative predictive value of (Pigmented Lesion Assay) PLA at 99% and found no significant adverse outcomes after long-term follow-up of PLA negative tests. </p>
<p>The stock price moved up 5.85% today, and 27.55% in afterhours on the positive results of the study.</p>

<h2 id="Opportunity"><a href="#Opportunity" class="headerlink" title="Opportunity"></a>Opportunity</h2><p>Early detection can be life-saving for some cancer patients, and with the added convenience of in home detection, and potentially lower costs DermTech could continue to garner support from both the clinical and insurance side.  In November, DermTeck announced it has entered an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois.</p>
<p>While this is still an early stage pre-revenue company and carries a lot of risk - it also has a lot of potential upside, with a market cap around 300 million. And as company has just recently received approved and launching to market, there will likely be more news and continued catalysts for the stock to make waves in the coming months.  We see a large market for DermTeck especially with the rapidly aging population. It is estimated that 1 in 5 adults will develop skin cancer by age 70.  And even with younger adults, the use of tanning beds in recent decades has increased Melanoma rates, which is the deadliest form of skin cancer. </p>

While this may help Tilray in the longer term, it’s been a troubled stock with a run up to around $150 in 2018 and lows under $5 as recently as this September.  The stock has suffered from dilution, and the company has a poor balance sheet.  Both stocks have benefited from the run up of cannabis stocks, and Tilray was up on the news while Aphria was mostly flat on the day.</p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>If we owned the stock, we would take our profits.  The stock has and will be volatile, and while this does periodically present some good options plays, we would not be long this stock. If investors are looking to get into this space, especially on the momentum of the future Democratic Presidential administration and a steady stream of states legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana, we think there are better weed stocks out there. One of our favorites is GrowGeneration (<strong>GRWG</strong>). It’s a grower supplier, and can be thought of as the picks and shovel of the industry, with a great balance sheet and impressive revenue growth  - up more than 11.50% today!</p>
<h3 id="Jumia-JMIA"><a href="#Jumia-JMIA" class="headerlink" title="Jumia (JMIA)"></a>Jumia (JMIA)</h3><p>The African e-commerce and payment platform has had a great month, up over 160% on the month, and has begun exceeding its previous 2020 highs.  We are long term bullish on Jumia and while there have been some mixed results in recent in quarterly earnings, it looks like the company is headed in the right direction and gross profit was up 22% and the operating loss has been nearly cut in half from the previous year. According to The Council on Foreign Relations internet access is growing much more rapidly in Africa than anywhere else in the world.  PWC projects that six of the world’s 10 fastest-growing economies are in Africa; for the period 2014-2050. We think given time, and proper execution it’s not infeasible to think JMIA could grow into what MercadoLibre (<strong>MELI</strong>) is in South America or Sea Limited (<strong>SE</strong>) is in Southeast Asia.  With a market cap just over 3 billion, given enough time, and some luck, we see a lot of potential long term upside.</p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>We are bullish on JMIA and long the stock. It’s just broke past its previous 2020 $38 high and if it can close above 40 may begin continue moving up in the short term. It is important to note, it’s been an incredibly volatile stock, and we’ve continued to add to the position on pullbacks.  Starting just a small position here may be prudent, and adding more if it dips to the mid/low 30s. Barring any broader market pullbacks this seems to be forming a base at around 30-32 over the past few weeks</p>

<h3 id="Gravity-GRVY"><a href="#Gravity-GRVY" class="headerlink" title="Gravity (GRVY)"></a>Gravity (GRVY)</h3><p>Gravity is a Korean gaming company, was up over 7% today and reached all-time highs. This is a stock that often flies under the radar, but we think is one investors may want to keep an eye out for. The company reported 76% growth last quarter, and had had consistently high triple digit revenue growth in previous years.<br>Ragnarok is the company’s wildly successful massive multiplayer game and while the company is Korean based, the game is popular throughout several regions of Asia.  Despite its massive run up, it still has a market cap of just over 1.3 billion - which based on its revenue growth and expense ratios is considerably cheaper than its peers.  As the company grows and garners analyst coverage and more investor attention we think this stock may have a lot more upside.  While some investors may be wary of investing in a company with focus primarily on a single game franchise, the type of massive multiplayer game has proven to be sticky for years, or even decades. This is especially true when paired with a growing audience base as GRVY has seen, since new product versions, upgrades and subscriptions offer continued revenue for years to come. </p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>The stock has been consolidating in the 170-185 range the past few weeks, and is beginning to break out. Starting a small position may be prudent, but volatility is high with a small cap stock like this so there may be a better time to enter the stock.  However, with new releases and potential to gain more mainstream notice from Wall Street with the recent growth, this may continue breaking out and get away for overly cautious investors. </p>

The pullback here is mostly a result of some healthy profit taking.<br>Beam is a very promising biotech company developing precision genetic editing medicines, utilizing the very hot CRSPR technology.  The company was founded by David Liu, a pioneer in the field, who previously founded Editas(<strong>EDIT</strong>) - another leader of the CRISPR biotech space.   Beam stands out in this field by its use of base editing which can target single edits in DNA with great precision with chemical reactions.  Other companies in the field like <strong>CRSP</strong>, <strong>EDIT</strong>, <strong>NTLA</strong> use genetic editing which make double-stranded cuts in the DNA, and while that technology is farther ahead, has technical issues that still need to be overcome – primarily unintended cuts in the DNA which may have unintended consequences like cancer.  But due to the greater efficiency in base editing technology, it generally has more precision and less issues with unwanted DNA changes to overcome.  Though these issues are not completely unheard of with base editing either and more work is needed especially since this is a newer technology.<br>While there are many diseases that BEAM could use this technology to potentially address, the most immediate one is sickle cell anemia which is caused by a point mutation, exactly what base editing could one day treat more efficiently than the more involved gene editing approach. In fact, BEAM is currently pursuing two different base editing approaches to treat red blood cell disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>While biotech companies have run up a lot over the last couple of months, and early stage companies like Beam will be especially volatile in the near term, we do like having at least a small portfolio allocation to a few of these early phase promising companies in this space. Pullbacks like today may present a good opportunity for investors with a long term horizon to begin scaling in to a position or add to an existing one.  Investors who want exposure to this exciting field, but want to reduce volatility and single stock risk could consider <strong>ARKG</strong>. AKRG is ARK Invest’s Genomic revolution ETF which includes BEAM as well as other CRISPR publicly traded companies.</p>

A  shareholder vote scheduled is for Dec. 17 to officially approve the deal.  It will then likely begin trading under OPEN as Opendoor Technologies starting on Monday, Dec. 21.   Today’s loss was probably mostly attributed to profit taking after a large run up, especially ahead of the merger, historically a volatile time for a SPACs<br>Opendoor is a leader in the iBuyer home space, which is a business model where a company buys homes directly from sellers, usually online, makes any needed repairs and upgrades and resells them.  In a growingly digital economy, with more and more millennial homeowners, with proper execution, it’s not hard to see considerable opportunity for years to come in this space.  And with Chamath’s leadership and the company recently announcing the hiring of several seasoned veterans in key leadership roles,  we don’t anticipate execution being a major risk.</p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>We do like Open-door, and the market agrees -  this SPAC is up 150%. With the merger happening over the next few days, it’s usually a very volatile time for SPACs .  So if investors don’t have a position we don’t think it’s the best time to enter, though that’s based on each investor’s own risk tolerance.  We do think growth investors should at least look into this name, and consider entering it on additional future dips.  We were in the IPOB SPAC from before the merger announcement, though have trimmed some of our initial position we intended to stay in the name. For a safer alternative, investors may want to look into Chamath’s other pre-merger announcements SPACs: <strong>IPOD</strong>, <strong>IPOE</strong>, <strong>IPOF</strong>. <a href="/2020/12/07/20201207_SPACs/">What is a SPAC?</a></p>

It included a the footnote which read “Confidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the US Securities and Exchange Commission”</p>
<p>This has lead to speculation on what this mystery business that Berkshire is accumulating a position in could be.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Berkshire has had such omissions in their filings, and was seen as recently as 2015 when Berkshire was building a position in Phillips 66.</p>
<img src="/images/BRK_RKT.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway and Rocket Companies">

<h3 id="What-we-know"><a href="#What-we-know" class="headerlink" title="What we know"></a>What we know</h3><p>Warren Buffet loves the insurance, banking and lending industry.  Up until recently, Berkshire Hathaway has been the largest shareholder of Wells Fargo. Over the past year they’ve been scaling back out of their position as the pandemic took a hard hit on the banking industry - and previous troubles at Wells Fargo, caused an even larger pullback for the bank than many of its peers.  One noteworthy aspect of Wells Fargo business is they are the second-largest US home mortgage lender.  The largest mortgage lender since 2018, has been Quicken Loans (RKT).   Given that Berkshire owns the majority of the national’s largest residential real estate brokerages, HomeServices of America, it would make sense to have a strategic partnership or investment with a large mortgage lender like Rocket.</p>
<p>There are reports from previous years that link Warren Buffett and Dan Gilbert, the co-founder of Quicken Loans, today a subsidiary of Rocket Companies (RKT).  A Fortune article from 2016  mentions “an exclusive mortgage-purchasing agreement between Quicken and a subsidiary of Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A)”.  In an interview with CNBC, Buffett has said “”I’m an enormous admirer of Dan and what he has accomplished in Quicken Loans”.  There have also been talks in previous years of the two partnering up to buy Yahoo. While we don’t have much details on their exact business dealings, there is evidence that there has been at least some level of talks and mutual admiration for years between the two men and their companies.</p>
<p>On November 11th 2020, Jay Farner, the CEO of Rocket Companies in an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer mentioned of an upcoming partnership with a “major large financial institution” that would be announced next year. Berkshire Hathaway would certainty fit the bill.</p>

In 1999, Intuit, the makers of Quicken, QuickBooks and Turbotax, bought Rock Financial.  A few years later Dan Gilbert and a group of private investors bought back the Quicken Loans subsidiary back from Intuit - but is why Intuit still retains products that share the “Quicken” name.<br>In 2016 Quicken Loans launched Rocket Mortgage which was the first fully online mortgage lender.<br>In the summer of 2020, the company was taken public, though the public float include just only a fraction of the overall shares.

<p>Dropbox (<strong>DBX</strong>) was up over 13 percent on Friday, with almost 8% of that coming in after hours.  After Slack’s (<a href="/tags/WORK">WORK</a>) buy out by Salesforce (<a href="/tags/CRM">CRM</a>) , there has been increased chatter among investors and analysts on what the next tech M&amp;A target could be.   On the morning of Friday December 11th, theinformation.com wrote an article making a case that DropBox, Box &amp; MongoDB could be acquisition targets.  However, this article does not have any inside information and is merely one author’s opinion on which companies may in the future be target of M&amp;A deals.   While prior to official Slack deal, the WSJ published an article reporting of talks between Slack and Salesforce which propelled Slack’s stock higher, there is no public news on any specific talks between Dropbox, Microsoft or any other companies.    </p>
<p>Dropbox is a 9.3 billion market cap company.  With a price to sales ratio of 5.6.  Dropbox revenue for the twelve trailing months ending September 30, 2020 was $1.856B, a 16.63% increase year-over-year.  While the revenue has been growing consistently, it has not grown at especially remarkable rates.  Still, it does not have currently have a premium evaluation and on a pullback may present on opportunity for investors to get into down the road. </p>
<img style="margin-left:0;" src="/images/DBX.png">

<h3 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p> The reasonable market cap makes a potential future acquisition feasible, especially in the growing workplace productivity space. However, there is no reason  to believe that such a deal is imminent.  Buying the stock after such a large run up, on no actual news or changes in it’s core business is dangerous and we are most likely going to see a correction in the price in the coming days. We think it’s best to stay out of this name for now.</p>

While many travel related stocks have already reclaimed a large percentage of their past year’s decline, even with dilution in many cases, there are areas of the market that still have a long road to complete recovery investors may want to consider.   Two such areas that have still the most to regain to get back to their pre-pandemic levels, are the oil sector and real estate sectors.</p>

<p>Investors seeking to play the oil recovery may be tempted to invest in United States Oil Fund (<em>USO</em>), the  commodity ETF which tracks oil prices through oil future contracts.  Trading currently in the low 30s, with pre-pandemic highs in the 120s, it may seem on the surface like a compelling trade.</p>
<p>However, digging a little deeper it’s unlikely USO will regain it’s previous highs. Prior to the April/May crude oil plunge which even got into negative priced oil future contracts, USO traded exclusively short dated, monthly WTI crude contracts. However, in light of that collapse USO made adjustments to their strategy, they would no longer hold and sell monthly contracts, they would also hold longer dates contracts which would be as long as a year out. </p>
<p>The fund has then made even more changes, where the contracts held are no longer exclusively crude oil.  USO is now including light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels.</p>
<img style="margin-left:0;" src="/images/USO.png" alt="USO vs Brent Crude Oil Correlation">

<p>Prior to the change, you can see that USO followed the price of crude oil closely.  However, since there has been a large divergence between the two. And while the price of crude has been increasing recently, the relative price of USO lags far behind.  Even if crude can eventually rebound, we would not expect USO to rebound higher than to the mid 40s and that is a best case scenario which may take years.  </p>
<p>While we are not bullish on oil long term, and think clean and renewable energy is a superior long term investments, we do think there are several oil companies which may make a good mid-term investment as the epidemic comes to an end, and travel eventually rebounds – but USO is far from the best one.</p>

This was in part due to their large reliance on the revenue from their largest customer, widely believed to be TikTok. Additionally, investors were not pleased when they learned insiders sold shares before announcing that news.  However, recent positive news on TikTok along with general strength of the market and cloud stocks in general has largely rebounded Fastly - though it’s still 30% short of it’s recent highs.</p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>Even before the previous earnings news and drop, the stock has had a very volatile year even as it’s up 365% over the last trailing year. For a trade, we wouldn’t enter the stock up here, though if you monitor your trades closely and it breaks out and closes past 100, it may continue to run to its previous highs in the high 120s, but any NASDAQ pullback could hit FSLY especially hard in the near term.  For investors with a longer horizon, we do like Fastly’s long term prospects, but make sure you can stomach a lot of volatility. The valuation is not cheap, but the market cap is small enough where continued growth could help push this stock higher over the coming years.  But we do think they’ll be better opportunities to enter this name.  We hold a long term Fastly position, and a trading position. The latter of which we started to trim over the past few days.</p>

<h3 id="Ontrak-OTRK"><a href="#Ontrak-OTRK" class="headerlink" title="Ontrak (OTRK)"></a>Ontrak (OTRK)</h3><p>You can think of it as the mental health little brother of Livongo(LVGO).   Ontrak has had a sharp decline over the last month, in part due to lowered guidance at last earnings and partially due to the weakness of  telemedicine stocks (TDOC, AMWL) on the vaccine news - despite the pandemic actually being a headwind for OTRK, unlike some of the other telemedicine companies.  Ontrak continues to deliver stellar growth with 130% revenue growth over the last three quarters of 2020.  And with a market cap under one billion, we think this has a lot of room to run in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>Up almost 8%, closing at $56.88 it could be the beginning of a nice breakout after a period of consolidation, and we expect it to in time return to it’s previous levels $60-$83 and eventually higher. We are bullish on OTRK, are long the stock and 50/55 December call debit spreads.</p>
<h3 id="Jumia-JMIA"><a href="#Jumia-JMIA" class="headerlink" title="Jumia (JMIA)"></a>Jumia (JMIA)</h3><p>The African e-commerce and payment platform has had a great month, up almost 120% on the month. While there have been some mixed results in recent in earnings, it looks like the company is headed in the right direction and gross profit was up 22% and the operating loss has been nearly cut in half from the previous year.  According to the Council on Foreign Relations, internet access will grow much more rapidly in Afrifca than anywhere else in the world and we think given time, and proper execution it’s not infeasible to think JMIA could grow into what MercadoLibre (MELI) is in South America or Sea Limited (SE) is in Southeast Asia.  With a market cap under 3 billion, given enough time, and some luck, we see a lot of potential long term upside.</p>
<p><strong>Trade</strong><br>We are bullish on JMIA and long the stock. However, it’s been incredibly volatile, and we continue to add to the position on pullbacks.  Starting just a small position here may be prudent, and adding more if it dips below 30 - though barring any broader market pullbacks this seems to be forming a base at around 30 over the past few weeks</p>

        <h3 id="Initial-Valuation"><a href="#Initial-Valuation" class="headerlink" title="Initial Valuation"></a>Initial Valuation</h3><p><strong>Updated 6:40pm EST</strong></p>
<p>Airbnb is set to go public on NASDAQ Thursday, December 10th, 2020, with the ticker <strong>ABNB</strong>.<br>As of Tuesday, the share price has been raised and is now in the $67-$68 per share range, up from the previous  $56 to $60 range, which was already up from the initial $44 to $50 price originally. With the new range, Airbnb would receive a fully diluted market value of $47 billion and is now planning on selling 52.9 million shares.</p>
<img width="200" src="/images/airbnb-Logo.png">

<p>Prior to the pandemic, the company was valued at more than $40 billion, however at the 2020 low, the valuation fell to less than $20 million. But now Wall Street seems to be pricing the company at an even higher valuation than its previous pre-pandemic highs.  For the first three quarter of 2020, with travel restrictions, Airbnb’s revenue dropped to 3.4 billion, but for 2022 the projections is a large rebound in revenue with sales increasing to $6 billion.</p>
<h3 id="Worth-getting-in-on-IPO"><a href="#Worth-getting-in-on-IPO" class="headerlink" title="Worth getting in on IPO?"></a>Worth getting in on IPO?</h3><p>While initially there may have been an attractive discount due to the pandemic on the Airbnb IPO price for long term investors, the price now reflects an optimistic, forward looking valuation.  Still, the planned offering market cap places them in line with the current market cap of Marriott, currently with a 43 billion market cap. And for investors with a long term time horizon, a continued strong execution could offers a lot more growth than investing in a legacy hotel operator.  Airbnb is a staple of the “sharing economy” and often compared to Uber in its business model - however, unlike Uber which has struggled with a model that is unprofitable, Airbnb has shown it’s been able to have profitable quarters. After deep cuts and layoffs in 2020, Airbnb did post a profit in Q3 2020 - something Uber has never been able to do.  </p>
<p>To fully understand the sharing economy, the vision and history of Airbnb we recommend the readers read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3mZHNlA">“The Upstarts” by Brad Stone</a>.  Not only is it informative, it’s very entertaining and one of the best reads on Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>If investors can get their hands on ABNB under $75, this may be an opportunity worth considering for investors with a long time horizon, who won’t be put off by near term volatility.</p>

<p>Flare Networks, a startup that is being backed by Ripple Labs, introduces a new way of scaling smart contract platforms that is fully integrated with XRP, using its native token, Spark (<strong>FLR</strong>). They have announced that they will be distributing FLR to eligible XRP holders.</p>
<p>There is currently a total supply of 100 billion FLR tokens, though 45 billion will be distributed to XRP holders at a minimum of 1:1 FLR to XRP. Because of all of the XRP held by Ripple employees who are ineligible to participate in the airdrop, the remaining amount of tokens will be distributed based on how much XRP is in your wallet compared to everyone else when the snapshot is taken, which will be at 00:00 UTC on December 12th.</p>
<p>There is a large list of eligible wallets and ledgers in which you can hold your XRP in, to claim the FLR airdrop. On Saturday, Coinbase had finally announced that they will allow the airdrop on their platform as well. However, they will not be allowing customers to add or remove XRP within a short period before and after the airdrop. You can find the comprehensive <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://flare.xyz/supporting-exchanges/">list here</a>. You can also use an XRP wallet such as XUMM, or use a Ledger Nano if you prefer storing your digital currency in physical form. You will need to make sure that your XRP Ledger account is prepared to receive the airdrop. You can find a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://flare.ghost.io/claiming-spark-faq/">tutorial here</a>.</p>
<p>15% of the distribution will occur at once at a not yet specified date after the snapshot, and the rest of the amount will be distributed over the next 2-3 years. Having such a long time for the token to be distributed could mean good things for it’s price long term, although the coin is expected to be worth less than a cent upon distribution.</p>
<p>Make sure not to miss the FLR airdrop. FLR is expected to solve a lot of problems in the crypto space surrounding trust, with the fastest transactions in the crypto space.</p>
